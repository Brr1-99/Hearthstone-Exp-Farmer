 Script that automates the fastest way to obtain experience in hearthstone.

 Shoutout to Zeddy Hearthstone for showing the method on his youtube channel.

 You can check the video on the following link [Zeddy's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miDBaEP1HxY)

Working steps:

- First the app asks you if you want to start the process.

- Then it opens the hearthstone app. **Make sure your mouse remains on your main screen!!**
    Pyautogui module is limited to the main screen of the device ðŸ˜¥.

- Next you enter the mercenaries mode and play the easiest task. You set all your attacks but do not press the 'Ready' button.

- Now you will leave the game and the script will start a timer for a ~30 min.
    This is the maximum time until Hearthstone shuts your session.

- After the timer passes, it will automatically open hearthstone again so you can finish the battle and start another one.

- Whenever hearthstone is closed it will ask you if you want to continue with this process of exp farming
    So, you can stop it whenever you want after each battle. 

All suggestions are welcomed in order to improve this proyect ðŸ˜Š.
